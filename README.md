#Parallel Community Detection using Stochastic Block Models (Par-SBM)
Version 0.1

This program is to identify non-overlapping communities for undirected networks. It provides good solutions for the input graphs that fit the stochastic block models (SBMs). Comparing with non-model based algorithms, it can provide a meaningful alternative solution for general input graphs. Comparing with other SBM-based algorithms, it runs faster and is more scalable on parallel computers. 

This program has been tested on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 with mpi-openmpi version 1.4.3 and gcc version 4.6.0. If you have found a bug or have problems, you may contact the authors in the citation below.
